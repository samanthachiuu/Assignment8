# DH150 Assignment8 - HighFi Prototype

This project is about finding a community that we are interested in exploring and understanding the needs of that community. For this project, I specifically focused on students and their time management skills. As a student myself, I know we are always so busy with school, classes, finding time to hang out with friends, therefore I thought about doing something that will help students with time management, like a calendar or planner but focused on 3 features: planning when to do homework, getting notified or a warning when scheduling overlapping events, and planning social events with friends. 

The process of this consisted of a 9 week long accelerator by starting with understanding heuristic evaluations of a website I wanted to look at, which was myucla.edu, to doing userbility testing of the website, to making a journey map from our personas, and finally making a prototype of our features we wanted to add to improve the user experience.

The purpose of this high-fidelity prototype is so that the users testing it can visually see what it would look like if it were a real app and come to life. The different tasks that the prototype demonstrates are scheduling time to do your homework and the option of locking social media applications as well if you have the app on your phone, getting a notification when you try to schedule multiple events at the same time or overlapping times so the user is aware of the time overlap, and being able to see your friends availability so you can schedule when to hangout with them or catch up.
